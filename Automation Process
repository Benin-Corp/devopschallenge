A Terraform Lightsail script with main.tf, output.tf and a Var.tf with a terrastate file in Terraform Cloud are needed for more automation.
In Github a webhook is configured everytime terraform apply output a new ip address if not static.

It establishes a secure connection to the AWS Lightsail server so that the compiled files can be synced

This is done via rsync and ssh

There is a env variable set in the GitHub settings, it contains the SSH key and a static IP address would have been added for more automation

Everytime the GitHub repo is updated, the Actions script gets automatically triggered. The following actions are performed;

It sets up a secure connection to the server.
Installs all node modules for backend.
Uploads the new backend to the server.
Restarts the pm2 server that serves the backend.
Compiles the react app.
Uploads it to server.
Server used is NGINX
